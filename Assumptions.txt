Following Assumptions were made while developing the GlobalBeverageCorporationExchange application

1)- Following attributes would always be greater than Zero
i)- Stock ParValue
ii)- Stock Price
iii)- Trade Quantity

2)- Application is assumed to be single threaded to make sure that 2 different instances of the Exchange do not record
trades at the same time. Locking/Unlocking mechanism will have to be implemented for critical sections
where trades are involved, if the application is multi-threaded. However, the state of the trades would be same across
two different exchange instances at any point in time, if the trades are recorded sequentially using 2 exchange objects.
Each of the exchange object can independently calculate Dividend_Yield, P/E ratio, Volume-Weighted-Average-Price and
GBCE-All-Share-Index independently.

3)- Since no Database Connections and I/O are allowed, trades cannot be made to persist permanently. Hence, will cease to
exist when the exchange object is destroyed and will have to be re-recorded every-time.
