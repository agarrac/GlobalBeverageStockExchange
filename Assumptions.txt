Following Assumptions were made while developing the GlobalBeverageCorporationExchange application

1)- Following attributes would always be greater than Zero
	i)- Stock ParValue
	ii)- Stock Price
	iii)- Trade Quantity

2)- Volume-Weighted-Stock-Price of any stock would always be 1 Pence (0.01 GBP) if no trade has been recorded for that stock
in past 5 minutes. Hence minimum value of GBCE-All-Share-Index would be 0.01 GBP.

3)- Application is assumed to be single threaded to make sure that 2 different instances of the Exchange do not record
trades at the same time. Locking/Unlocking mechanism will have to be implemented for critical sections
where trades are involved, if the application is multi-threaded. However, the state of the trades would be same across
different exchange instances at any point in time, if the trades are recorded at different points in time
using different exchange objects. Each of the exchange object can calculate Dividend_Yield, P/E ratio, Volume-Weighted-Average-Price and
GBCE-All-Share-Index independently.

4)- Since no Database Connections and I/O are allowed, trades cannot be made to persist permanently. Hence, will cease to
exist when the exchange object is destroyed and will have to be re-recorded every-time.
